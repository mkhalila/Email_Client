# Email_Client

## Motivation 
Recently I moved over to the Linux world from Windows because 2 years into a Computer Science degree at King's College London, I felt that Windows (imo) is a pain to develop on in comparison to a Unix based system. (And no, I do not have the money to buy a Mac). 

After using Linux for a bit, I missed the old Outlook email client from Windows 10. Personally, I didn't like any of the popular email clients on Linux (Thunderbird, KMail etc.) because (imo) they were:
1. *ugly*
2. Had an over-complicated, un-intuitive UI
3. Not as easy to use as Outlook or similar email clients
4. **ugly**

Geary looked fairly simple and easy to use, but well, *just not pretty enough*. Also lacked support for Exchange accounts.

I then came accross what I felt was the perfect email client. Nylas N1. It was beautiful, easy to set up and use. But:
1. You have to pay for it - *I'm not going to do pay almost $100/yr for an Email client...*
2. All emails are (by default) synched through Nylas' own servers - *Kinda intrusive, no?*

And so here we are. I wanted to create a solution. 

## The Project
This project intends to create an email client with the following features:
1. **free**
2. Easy to use
3. Minimal, intuitive UI & good looking - *ideally something straight out of Apple*
4. Cross-Platform
5. Priotises privacy and security

## Who can Contribute
Everyone has amazing skills and ideas that will be a useful asset to delivering on the aforementioned vision.
However, it's just the beginning so if anyone is interested in contributing then feel free to contact me on *quotation forthcoming*

## Language
This project will be written in Java because I feel this is my strongest language at this time. JavaFX will be used to create the front-end.
N.B. This is just the beginning. This could change drastically as the project gathers pace.
